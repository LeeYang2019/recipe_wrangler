# recipe_wrangler

## Description

For this program I maintained a database system for storing and retrieving recipes. Each recipe has a name, a list of ingredients, and instructions. 

The program adds recipes from a file at the start and then allows the user to add and edit recipes. The program user is able to list the available recipe names and display the information about a specific recipe.  When the program starts, the user is asked for recipe file and the program loads all recipes found in the file. When the program ends, the user is asked for a filename to write (save) all recipes.  The save overwrites the file if it already exists.

## Goals

### The following are what I learned from the project:

        Write a program that conforms to a specified user interface.
        Warning! Your solution will be tested using an automatic testing suite and failure to produce output as specified will mean that your solution will fail many tests and lose many points.
        Use arrays (or ArrayLists of objects) to store [expandable] lists of data.
        Implement the java.lang.Comparable interface (for sorting)
        Read data from a File (file input).
        Write data to a File (file output).
        Implement basic exception handling (must handle FileNotFoundExceptions using try/catch somewhere in program).
        Implement an entire program from scratch (no skeleton files! -- we will suggest a basic Object-Oriented design) .
        Employ good software design principles:
            design and implement instantiable classes for things like recipes, and lists of recipes
            protect data via encapsulation (private fields and public methods as needed)
            Understand, implement, and use constructors for instantiable classes.
